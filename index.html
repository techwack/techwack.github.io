    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\nahat\OneDrive\Desktop\my-portfolio\pictures\myphoto.jpg" alt="Divyanshi Jain" class="profile-photo">
    <p>Hey there! I‚Äôm Divyanshi Jain, a 20-year-old student navigating the crazy Engineering life at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. But, life's not just about coding. I‚Äôm someone who loves to learn, explore, and, yes, maybe even fail a few times along the way (looking at you, skateboarding skills!). üõπ</p>
    <p>When I‚Äôm not glued to my laptop trying to make machines smarter, I‚Äôm out there living life. Whether it's chasing new skills like learning how to cook or just trying to keep my plants alive, I believe in making life a little more exciting every day. üå±</p>
    <p>I‚Äôm living away from home to study, and trust me, it's a wild ride! From managing my laundry skills to surviving on instant noodles, it‚Äôs all part of the <span style="color: #ff6347; font-weight: bold;">‚ÄúCollege Life‚Äù</span> experience. But hey, I‚Äôm learning to balance my academics, hackathons, and the art of making <span style="color: #ffeb3b; font-weight: bold;">amazing to-do lists</span> (I‚Äôm secretly obsessed with them). üôå</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, I‚Äôm excited about diving deeper into the world of AI (yup, still a fan!) but also exploring cool new things like game development. And who knows? Maybe one day, I‚Äôll build something that makes your morning a little brighter. ‚òïÔ∏è</p>
    <p>Learn from anyone you meet!! explore-explore-explore</p>
